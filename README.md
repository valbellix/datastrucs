# libdatastructs
The objective of this project is my own fun. I used to be a weirdos so I am having some fun writing some C code to implement data structures.

# Build Instructions
There is a CMakeLists.txt file you can use to generate your preferred way to build this library. I really like to do out-of-source build and I encourage you to do the same. For example, you can generate makefiles (or VS projects) by:
```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

# Disclaimer
This code is likely to be very buggy so use it at your own risk.
